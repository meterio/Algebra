Provides quotes for swaps

Allows getting the expected amount out or amount in for a given swap without executing the swap

*Developer note: These functions are not gas efficient and should _not_ be called on chain. Instead, optimistically execute
the swap and check the amounts in the callback.

## Functions
### constructor


`constructor(address _factory, address _WNativeToken, address _poolDeployer) public`  public





| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| _factory | address |  |
| _WNativeToken | address |  |
| _poolDeployer | address |  |


### algebraSwapCallback


`function algebraSwapCallback(int256 amount0Delta, int256 amount1Delta, bytes path) external view` view external

Called to &#x60;msg.sender&#x60; after executing a swap via IAlgebraPool#swap.
*Developer note: In the implementation you must pay the pool tokens owed for the swap.
The caller of this method _must_ be checked to be a AlgebraPool deployed by the canonical AlgebraFactory.
amount0Delta and amount1Delta can both be 0 if no tokens were swapped.*



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| amount0Delta | int256 | The amount of token0 that was sent (negative) or must be received (positive) by the pool by the end of the swap. If positive, the callback must send that amount of token0 to the pool. |
| amount1Delta | int256 | The amount of token1 that was sent (negative) or must be received (positive) by the pool by the end of the swap. If positive, the callback must send that amount of token1 to the pool. |
| path | bytes |  |
