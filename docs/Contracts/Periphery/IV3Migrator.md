## Functions
### migrate


`function migrate(struct IV3Migrator.MigrateParams params) external`  external

Migrates liquidity to Algebra by burning v2 liquidity and minting a new position for Algebra
*Developer note: Slippage protection is enforced via &#x60;amount{0,1}Min&#x60;, which should be a discount of the expected values of
the maximum amount of Algebra liquidity that the v2 liquidity can get. For the special case of migrating to an
out-of-range position, &#x60;amount{0,1}Min&#x60; may be set to 0, enforcing that the position remains out of range*
