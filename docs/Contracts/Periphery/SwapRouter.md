## Functions
### constructor


`constructor(address _factory, address _WNativeToken, address _poolDeployer) public`  public





| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| _factory | address |  |
| _WNativeToken | address |  |
| _poolDeployer | address |  |


### algebraSwapCallback


`function algebraSwapCallback(int256 amount0Delta, int256 amount1Delta, bytes _data) external`  external

Called to &#x60;msg.sender&#x60; after executing a swap via IAlgebraPool#swap.
*Developer note: In the implementation you must pay the pool tokens owed for the swap.
The caller of this method _must_ be checked to be a AlgebraPool deployed by the canonical AlgebraFactory.
amount0Delta and amount1Delta can both be 0 if no tokens were swapped.*



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| amount0Delta | int256 | The amount of token0 that was sent (negative) or must be received (positive) by the pool by the end of the swap. If positive, the callback must send that amount of token0 to the pool. |
| amount1Delta | int256 | The amount of token1 that was sent (negative) or must be received (positive) by the pool by the end of the swap. If positive, the callback must send that amount of token1 to the pool. |
| _data | bytes |  |


### exactInputSingle


`function exactInputSingle(struct ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams params) external payable returns (uint256 amountOut)` payable external

Swaps &#x60;amountIn&#x60; of one token for as much as possible of another token



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| params | struct ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams | The parameters necessary for the swap, encoded as &#x60;ExactInputSingleParams&#x60; in calldata |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| amountOut | uint256 | The amount of the received token |

### exactInput


`function exactInput(struct ISwapRouter.ExactInputParams params) external payable returns (uint256 amountOut)` payable external

Swaps &#x60;amountIn&#x60; of one token for as much as possible of another along the specified path



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| params | struct ISwapRouter.ExactInputParams | The parameters necessary for the multi-hop swap, encoded as &#x60;ExactInputParams&#x60; in calldata |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| amountOut | uint256 | The amount of the received token |

### exactInputSingleSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens


`function exactInputSingleSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(struct ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams params) external returns (uint256 amountOut)`  external

Swaps &#x60;amountIn&#x60; of one token for as much as possible of another along the specified path
*Developer note: Unlike standard swaps, handles transferring from user before the actual swap.*



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| params | struct ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams | The parameters necessary for the multi-hop swap, encoded as &#x60;ExactInputParams&#x60; in calldata |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| amountOut | uint256 | The amount of the received token |

### exactOutputSingle


`function exactOutputSingle(struct ISwapRouter.ExactOutputSingleParams params) external payable returns (uint256 amountIn)` payable external

Swaps as little as possible of one token for &#x60;amountOut&#x60; of another token



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| params | struct ISwapRouter.ExactOutputSingleParams | The parameters necessary for the swap, encoded as &#x60;ExactOutputSingleParams&#x60; in calldata |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| amountIn | uint256 | The amount of the input token |

### exactOutput


`function exactOutput(struct ISwapRouter.ExactOutputParams params) external payable returns (uint256 amountIn)` payable external

Swaps as little as possible of one token for &#x60;amountOut&#x60; of another along the specified path (reversed)



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| params | struct ISwapRouter.ExactOutputParams | The parameters necessary for the multi-hop swap, encoded as &#x60;ExactOutputParams&#x60; in calldata |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| amountIn | uint256 | The amount of the input token |
