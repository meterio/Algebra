# DataStorageOperator


Algebra timepoints data operator

This contract stores timepoints and calculates adaptive fee and statistical averages


## Modifiers
### onlyPool


`modifier onlyPool()`  internal









## Variables
### struct DataStorage.Timepoint[65536] timepoints 

Returns data belonging to a certain timepoint

*Developer note: There is more convenient function to fetch a timepoint: getTimepoints(). Which requires not an index but seconds*
### struct AlgebraFeeConfiguration feeConfig 



### bytes32 FEE_CONFIG_MANAGER constant



*Developer note: The role can be granted in AlgebraFactory*

## Functions
### constructor


`constructor(address _pool) public`  public





| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| _pool | address |  |


### initialize


`function initialize(uint32 time, int24 tick) external`  external

Initialize the dataStorage array by writing the first slot. Called once for the lifecycle of the timepoints array



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| time | uint32 | The time of the dataStorage initialization, via block.timestamp truncated to uint32 |
| tick | int24 | Initial tick |


### changeFeeConfiguration


`function changeFeeConfiguration(struct AlgebraFeeConfiguration _config) external`  external

Changes fee configuration for the pool



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| _config | struct AlgebraFeeConfiguration |  |


### getSingleTimepoint


`function getSingleTimepoint(uint32 time, uint32 secondsAgo, int24 tick, uint16 lastIndex) external view returns (int56 tickCumulative, uint112 volatilityCumulative)` view external


*Developer note: Reverts if a timepoint at or before the desired timepoint timestamp does not exist.
0 may be passed as &#x60;secondsAgo&#x27; to return the current cumulative values.
If called with a timestamp falling between two timepoints, returns the counterfactual accumulator values
at exactly the timestamp between the two timepoints.*



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| time | uint32 | The current block timestamp |
| secondsAgo | uint32 | The amount of time to look back, in seconds, at which point to return a timepoint |
| tick | int24 | The current tick |
| lastIndex | uint16 |  |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| tickCumulative | int56 | The cumulative tick since the pool was first initialized, as of &#x60;secondsAgo&#x60; |
| volatilityCumulative | uint112 | The cumulative volatility value since the pool was first initialized, as of &#x60;secondsAgo&#x60; |

### getTimepoints


`function getTimepoints(uint32[] secondsAgos) external view returns (int56[] tickCumulatives, uint112[] volatilityCumulatives)` view external

Returns the accumulator values as of each time seconds ago from the given time in the array of &#x60;secondsAgos&#x60;
*Developer note: Reverts if &#x60;secondsAgos&#x60; &gt; oldest timepoint*



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| secondsAgos | uint32[] | Each amount of time to look back, in seconds, at which point to return a timepoint |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| tickCumulatives | int56[] | The cumulative tick since the pool was first initialized, as of each &#x60;secondsAgo&#x60; |
| volatilityCumulatives | uint112[] | The cumulative volatility values since the pool was first initialized, as of each &#x60;secondsAgo&#x60; |

### write


`function write(uint16 index, uint32 blockTimestamp, int24 tick) external returns (uint16 indexUpdated, uint16 newFee)`  external

Writes a dataStorage timepoint to the array
*Developer note: Writable at most once per block. Index represents the most recently written element. index must be tracked externally.*



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| index | uint16 | The index of the timepoint that was most recently written to the timepoints array |
| blockTimestamp | uint32 | The timestamp of the new timepoint |
| tick | int24 | The active tick at the time of the new timepoint |

**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| indexUpdated | uint16 | The new index of the most recently written element in the dataStorage array |
| newFee | uint16 | The fee in hundredths of a bip, i.e. 1e-6 |

### prepayTimepointsStorageSlots


`function prepayTimepointsStorageSlots(uint16 startIndex, uint16 amount) external`  external

Fills uninitialized timepoints with nonzero value
*Developer note: Can be used to reduce the gas cost of future swaps*



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| startIndex | uint16 | The start index, must be not initialized |
| amount | uint16 | of slots to fill, startIndex + amount must be &lt;&#x3D; type(uint16).max |
