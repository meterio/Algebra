*Developer note: Mint/Burn/Swap cannot be emitted by the pool before Initialize*



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| price | uint160 | The initial sqrt price of the pool, as a Q64.96 |
| tick | int24 | The initial tick of the pool, i.e. log base 1.0001 of the starting price of the pool |


### Mint


`event Mint(address sender, address owner, int24 bottomTick, int24 topTick, uint128 liquidityAmount, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)`  

Emitted when liquidity is minted for a given position
*Developer note: If the top and bottom ticks match, this should be treated as a limit order*



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| sender | address | The address that minted the liquidity |
| owner | address | The owner of the position and recipient of any minted liquidity |
| bottomTick | int24 | The lower tick of the position |
| topTick | int24 | The upper tick of the position |
| liquidityAmount | uint128 | The amount of liquidity minted to the position range |
| amount0 | uint256 | How much token0 was required for the minted liquidity |
| amount1 | uint256 | How much token1 was required for the minted liquidity |


### Collect


`event Collect(address owner, address recipient, int24 bottomTick, int24 topTick, uint128 amount0, uint128 amount1)`  

Emitted when fees are collected by the owner of a position
*Developer note: Collect events may be emitted with zero amount0 and amount1 when the caller chooses not to collect fees*



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| owner | address | The owner of the position for which fees are collected |
| recipient | address | The address that received fees |
| bottomTick | int24 | The lower tick of the position |
| topTick | int24 | The upper tick of the position |
| amount0 | uint128 | The amount of token0 fees collected |
| amount1 | uint128 | The amount of token1 fees collected |


### Burn


`event Burn(address owner, int24 bottomTick, int24 topTick, uint128 liquidityAmount, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)`  

Emitted when a position&#x27;s liquidity is removed
*Developer note: Does not withdraw any fees earned by the liquidity position, which must be withdrawn via #collect*



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| owner | address | The owner of the position for which liquidity is removed |
| bottomTick | int24 | The lower tick of the position |
| topTick | int24 | The upper tick of the position |
| liquidityAmount | uint128 | The amount of liquidity to remove |

| amount1 | uint256 | The amount of token1 withdrawn |


### Swap


`event Swap(address sender, address recipient, int256 amount0, int256 amount1, uint160 price, uint128 liquidity, int24 tick)`  

Emitted by the pool for any swaps between token0 and token1



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
