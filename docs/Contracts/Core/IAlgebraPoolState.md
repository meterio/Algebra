## Functions
### globalState


`function globalState() external view returns (uint160 price, int24 tick, int24 prevInitializedTick, uint16 fee, uint16 timepointIndex, uint8 communityFee, bool unlocked)` view external

The globalState structure in the pool stores many values but requires only one slot
and is exposed as a single method to save gas when accessed externally.




**Returns:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| price | uint160 | The current price of the pool as a sqrt(dToken1/dToken0) Q64.96 value; |
| tick | int24 | The current tick of the pool, i.e. according to the last tick transition that was run; This value may not always be equal to SqrtTickMath.getTickAtSqrtRatio(price) if the price is on a tick boundary; |
| prevInitializedTick | int24 | The previous initialized tick |
| fee | uint16 | The last pool fee value in hundredths of a bip, i.e. 1e-6 |
| timepointIndex | uint16 | The index of the last written timepoint |

### tickSpacing


`function tickSpacing() external view returns (int24)` view external
